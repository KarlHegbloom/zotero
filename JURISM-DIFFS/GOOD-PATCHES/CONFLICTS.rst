+Juris-M and Zotero
+==================
+
+With extension signing coming soon to Firefox, and MLZ on the verge of
+the Juris-M rebranding, this is a good time to think about how to be a
+better neighbour to Zotero.
+
+Juris-M (JM aka MLZ) is a drop-in replacement for Zotero for Firefox
+(ZF).  As such, it should yield when ZF is installed and
+enabled. How to make that happen is the puzzle of the moment.
+
+--------------------------
+An approach that will work
+--------------------------
+
+If the install ID, contractIDs and classIDs of Juris-M are aligned
+with Zotero, but Juris-M is set up to clone the Zotero DB (if one
+exists) rather than modifying it in place, we get what we're after:
+
+1. Only one of Zotero or Juris-M can be installed in a single Firefox profile; and
+2. User data is not affected when either is installed over the other.
+
+Completely overwriting the Zotero extension at first seems an unfriendly
+approach, but with the clone of the DB, it seems the best way of
+dovetailing the two systems. If agreement and approvals can be arranged ...
+
+------------------------------
+An approach that will not work
+------------------------------
+
+I begin with the idea of giving Juris-M its own installer ID.
+This did not have a happy ending ...
+
+    The problem is greatly simplified by the fact that both JM and ZF are
+    "restartful." While is to not possible to prevent the installation of
+    both plugins in a single instance of Firefox, installs do not take
+    effect immediately, and the conflict can be known at system startup.
+    It should be possible to assure that JM, as the "junior partner" in
+    the relationship, "sleeps" when Zotero is installed and enabled.
+    
+    There are four possible scenarios:
+    
+    1. JM only installed and enabled (no problem)
+    2. ZF only installed and enabled (ditto)
+    3. JM enabled, then ZF installed, followed by restart.
+    4. ZF enabled, then JM installed, followed by restart.
+    5. ZF enabled, JM sleeping, then ZF removed or disabled, followed by restart.
+    6. ZF enabled, JM sleeping, then JM removed or disabled, followed by restart.
+    
+    States 1 & 2 are no problem, of course; the extensions just do their thing as usual.
+    
+    For states 3 & 4, a ZF-detection function can be run immediately on JM install,
+    and in an observer triggered by extension install/uninstall and enable/disable.
+    The function would set a flag in JM preferences to indicate whether ZF is known
+    to be present.
+    
+    For states 5 & 6, the JM preference flag can be read at startup to put JM
+    in sleeper mode. When sleeping, the only JM functionality that runs is the
+    ZF-detection observer. If ZF is removed from the system, the JM preference
+    is unset, and on restart JM will come up in state 1.
+    
+    Should work. :-)
+
+In fact, that did not work out well at all. When only the installer ID is
+changed in Juris-M, the clash of classIDs in the second of the two to hit
+the Extension Manager cause it to barf: the first-loaded extension is destroyed, and
+the second fails to load. What the user sees is ... nothing. Both extensions
+appear in the Add-Ons, but neither produces any UI. Very bad.
+
+If the classIDs for Juris-M are made unique, we just get errors in the JavaScript
+itself - which makes sense, since both Zotero and Juris-M are writing into the
+same namespace.
+
+Taking this further will just lead further down the rabbit-hole.
