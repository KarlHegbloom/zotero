+============
+`locale-rev`
+============
+
+This directory is used by the `locale_update.py` tool, run
+immediately before a release to reconcile non-English locales
+with the English master.
+
+The directory holds (possibly partial) native locale data,
+typically copied in from the Zotero 4.0 branch. This is the
+normal channel for locale updates prior to release.
